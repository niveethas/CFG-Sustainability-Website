              <p id = "intro-para" class = "AboutUsIntro">
                In our busy, modern lives it may seem that we have too much to worry about ourselves to really focus on moving towards more sustainable living. 
                However, we built this site to highlight that it can actually be very easy to make small changes at home that can have a big impact.
                Many of us now live in compact, urban spaces and we have focused on several key elements of the modern, urban living space to demonstrate how we can make these spaces more harmonious with the environment and more eco friendly.
              <br><br>
                Many eco-friendly sites focus on muted, earthy tones but we have chosen to go with a vibrant, sunny site to highlight that sustainable living can be engaging, bright and doesn't have to only be done in one way.
                Across each of the living spaces featured we discuss sustainable swaps, useful products and interesting ways that we can incorporate a more eco-friendly outlook into the everyday.
                We hope you enjoy browsing our site as much as we enjoyed making it.

                                    Hello, I'm Niveetha! I'm a 19 year old second year student, studying Computer Science at Nottingham Trent University.
                                    I wanted to take on the Web Development course, by Code First Girls, because I had never used JavaScript or Bootstrap. 
                                    This has been a wonderful learning opportunity, not only in terms of programming but as a chance to work with new people!
                                    Yamona initiated the idea of a sustainability focused website and I was immediately intrigued. I believe actively working
                                    to be more eco-friendly should be a significant part of our lives and this website is a great starting place!
                                  </p>

                                    Hi, I’m Yamona! I’m 24 and currently studying a Master in Management in Madrid, Spain. 
                                    I started the Code First Girls Web Development course because I’ve always been interested in finding out more about coding, but never had the guts to try until now! 
                                    When we had the chance to create our own website, it was a no-brainer for me to do it about sustainability. 
                                    I’ve always been an advocate and with everything going on at the moment, it’s never been more important. 
                                    I hope this website can be an inspiration for people to start helping with small actions, for a better world!
                                  </p>

                                    I'm Laura! I'm a 24 year old trainee solicitor currently based in Scotland, having previously studied law at Edinburgh, Glasgow and KU Leuven in Belgium. 
                                    I wanted to learn coding as I am very keen on pursuing a career as a technology lawyer, and understanding what is behind the websites we interact with every day was really appealing! 
                                    Making this website focused around sustainability was ideal as I am moving towards a more zero waste, minimalist outlook so I was able to combine coding with one of my main interests and learn more along the way.
