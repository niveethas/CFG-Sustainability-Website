            <h3> We breathe to live, but have you ever thought of what you’re breathing in?</h3>
                <p> Air fresheners contain toxic chemicals that can cause a range of adverse health effects. 
                    Essential oils are a perfect alternative to not only ensure that your bedroom smells wonderful but that provides plenty of health benefits. 
                    Essential oils are made from plants and can be used topically, internally, or through diffusion in the air. 
                    All you need is a small diffuser and the essential oil of your choice, based on its specific health attributes. 
                    Always check the label for any use instructions and don’t worry, nowadays, you can get a diffuser to easily match your bedroom decor!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Allergens can be present in our bedroom air without us even knowing. 
                    Plants are a great natural way to purify the air, remove toxins and increase oxygen and moisture levels! 
                    All these factors will help you sleep more easily and can prevent sore or dry throats in the morning. 
                    A great example are Gerbera plants. They release oxygen in the evening so they are known to improve sleep quality. And they bloom beautiful flowers!
                    Not a big plant fan? Then run over to the store and get yourself an air purifier. 
                    Be careful though, they can also create waste so look for more sustainable options that use natural ingredients. 
                    Last but not least, you can also buy a Himalayan pink salt lamp. 
                    This beautiful salt is known for its purification capabilities and makes for a calming addition to your bedroom. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    While it’s best to purify what’s already in the air, let’s not forget about not unconsciously adding toxins with our candles. 
                    Yes, petroleum-based candles release toxic fumes full of chemicals that we breathe in. 
                    Instead, treat yourself to some soy-based or natural beeswax candles. 
                    These are all natural and you won’t even notice the difference. 
                    You can even find scented soy-based one that are infused with essential oils!
                    </p>

                                <h3> Have your clothes been hurting the environment? </h3>
                                    <p> The materials used to make clothes can be extremely harmful to the environment, particularly synthetic materials such 
                                        as polyester, acrylic and nylon (that release microfibres of plastic into the water), 
                                        or the mass use of cotton and cashmere (both limited natural resources). 
                                        Responsible shopping is a must and can be easy to do, so here are a few tips for you:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Try to join the circular economy by buying vintage or second-hand, or even renting those once-in-a-lifetime pieces. </li>
                                            <li>Clothes can be trans-seasonal rather than seasonal, simply through layering.</li>
                                            <li>Donate those clothes that just don’t fit your style anymore; alternatively, find a tailor (or DIY) to repair them or transform them in a new in-season item.</li>
                                            <li>Take the time to research a brand and how their clothes are made; you are the client, 
                                                ask yourself the right questions: 
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Are the materials used sustainable? </li>
                                                <li>What were the conditions of production? </li>
                                                <li>Will I wear this more than 30 times?</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Prioritise quality over quantity and when you do own a piece of clothing, care for it to ensure it has a long life. </li>
                                        </ul>  
                                        </p>

                                        <h3> And here are some other things to think about…</h3>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>When possible, choose secondhand for your furniture as well or make sure it is FSC certified. 
                                                        This means sustainably-sourced timber was used in the production, which gives back to local communities.</li>
                                                    <li>LED lights for all lamps and even ceiling lights. They use less energy and last longer. 
                                                        Although the initial cost seem seem higher than standard lights, in the long-run you’ll soon realise you save much more this way. </li>
                                                    <li>This may seem obvious but we’ll put it out there anyway! 
                                                        Heating systems run on fossil fuels, which add to our carbon footprint. 
                                                        Lowering your heater to 19°C or less can reduce your impact and be beneficial for your health, 
                                                        as it will boost your immunity and metabolism. </li>
                                                    <li>And for the next time you’re giving your bedroom a makeover, keep in mind that paint emits chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOC) continuously, 
                                                        not just when it was painted. Continued exposure can lead to respiratory issues, so instead of that, simply spring for a low-VOC paint. </li>
                                                    </ul>
